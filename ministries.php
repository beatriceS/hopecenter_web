        <p> A core value of Hope Center of Christ is to bring hope to the hopeless in our community through our words and our works.  Our call is to the forgotten and the hopeless of Central Orange County.  We believe that there are many who, for a variety of reasons, aren’t able to come to hope.  As a result, we are committed to bringing hope to them, to demonstrate to them in a tangible way that God has not forgotten them.  We are privileged to partner with Orange County Rescue Mission’s Chili Van.  The third Saturday of every other month we bring hope via the the chili van to motel families in Orange County.<br><br>
	It is our fervent desire to continue to finding needs in our community and filling them in the days and years to come. </p>
